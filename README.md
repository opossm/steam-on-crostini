# steam-on-crostini
A Steam installation script for Crostini/Includes fixes for Source Engine games

This is a small utility I created for installing and configuring Steam on Linux for Chromebooks.
NOTE THIS ONLY WORKS FOR x86 ARCH!

How to run it:
===========
First run 'sudo chmod a+rwx' on all of the files in the folder

Then run steam-install.sh

If Source is having issues with color shift, use source-fix.sh

!This will be updated eventually!

Known Issues
===========
- Some steam.desktop files are empty, but that's a Valve fault. This tool may not work if your .desktop file is empty
