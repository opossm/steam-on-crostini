# steam-on-crostini
A Steam installation script for Crostini/Includes fixes for Source Engine games

This is a small utility I created for installing and configuring Steam on Linux for Chromebooks.
NOTE THIS ONLY WORKS FOR x86_64 architecture Chromebooks - ARM Chromebooks will **NOT** work with this script.

How to run it:
===========
1. Install the code as a zip and move it to your Linux folder.
2. Navigate to the folder in the Linux terminal.
3. In the folder, run `sudo chmod a+rwx *.sh`.
4. Run steam-install.sh using `./steam-install.sh`

Then run steam-install.sh

If Source is having issues with color shift, use source-fix.sh and follow the instructions given by the script

Known Issues
===========
- Some steam.desktop files are empty. I have attempted to patch it by copying the file directly after configuration.

Planned Features
===========
- Better GUI maybe?
- Easier to use and execute script
